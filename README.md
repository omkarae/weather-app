# weather-app


## This is an app that I made to check weather of any city entered by user.
- I have used openweather API for the same. 
- After the user enters the city tht Openweather API is called and the result is displayed using ejs templating.
- Instead of saving the API options in the code itself, it is stored in .env environment variable is used in the code using dotenv modele.
